A few notes on my final project. 

First, I borrowed most of your HTML and CSS to save me time to focus 
on the PHP portion, so thank you for that.

I included the extra credit display page when no website or an invalid 
one is passed in the URL to the index page. The user is able to click "View" to be redirected
to the index page with the information populated from the page the user chose.

For the phone number validation I went with requiring a 10 digit int value since the database
had a length limitation of 10.

I did my best to comment the functions where applicable. I skipped commenting the 
setters and getters as I felt they were self explanatory.

If you run into any issues or have any questions, just let me know - jmkeyes@email.neit.edu

Thanks!
Josh
